{# Create a list of revisitable tracks per username.

  This involves some custom logic to detect a track that has historically been listened
  to a lot, but not recently.

  In particluar, the measurements are:

   - listens_old: the number of listens older than 90 days
   - listens_recent: the number of listens in the last 90 days
